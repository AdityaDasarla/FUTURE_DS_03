# FUTURE_DS_03 🚀  
A data science mini-project focused on sentiment analysis, visualization, and performance evaluation using Python and Power BI.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student satisfaction survey data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment insights. It includes:
- Text preprocessing and sentiment scoring
- Visualizations using Power BI
- Cleaned datasets and reproducible Python scripts

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🔍 **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `TextBlob` and `VADER` to classify feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- 📊 **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive report showing sentiment trends, satisfaction scores, and department-wise breakdowns.
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Handles nulls, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- 📁 **Modular Codebase**: Easy to read, scalable, and well-documented.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub
